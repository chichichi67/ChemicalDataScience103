# DSA103

Repository for the course DSA103 Advanced Chemical Data Science. All course material will be shared here, wheras OLAT will only be used for all course-related communication.

Instructors and persons responsible for the course: Prof. Meredith C. Schuman (meredithchristine.schuman@uzh.ch), Dr. Johannes Schörgenhumer (johannes.schoergenhumer@chem.uzh.ch)

Teaching assistant: Dimitrios Xynos (dimitrios.xynos@chem.uzh.ch)


## Prerequisites
Throughout this course, you will need your personal computer, please bring it to every session. You will use several tools, which have to be installed on your PC (if you have done the DSA101, you might already know some of them). We highly recommend to have your computer set up appropriately before the first lecture:

1) Git/Github: Make sure you have Git installed and a GitHub account. 
2) We will use the package manager uv and its virtual environment (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Follow the instructions on the website to install uv. In some cases (on Windows), you will get an error about an ExecutionPolicy. In order to remedy that, open a Power Shell Terminal as administrator and `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine`. Find out more here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.5.
3) IDE: For running code and Jupyter notebooks and for facilitating version control, we will be using an IDE. All demonstration will be done in Visual Studio Code, but other development environments, such as Pycharm, work as well. Whatever IDE you are using, make sure that you keep it and its extensions (e.g. for Jupyter and Python) up to date and that you are familiar with the working environment. **In VSCode, you will need extensions for Jupyter and Python installed!**

If anything else is going to be required, you will be notified in due course.

## How to work with this repository
The initial steps:
1) Fork the repository using the Fork button on GitHub.
2) Clone your fork. Please note that folders linked to cloud storage (e.g. OneDrive) can potentially cause issues with the paths. If you experience any warnings or errors in this direction, we recommend moving the files outside of the cloud environment.
3) Create a virtual environment, by running `uv venv` in the terminal (in the IDE).
4) Activate the virtual environment via the terminal (on Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`, on Linux/Mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`).
5) Run the command `uv sync` to synchronize the environment with the provided lock file. Any missing dependencies will be thereby installed.
6) Select the Python interpreter from the DSA103 environment (in VSC: click in the Search bar, hit Ctrl+P, then type "Python: Select Interpreter" - or use the button in the lower right corner of the window). Likewise you can can set the Interpreter for Jupyter notebooks.

This repository will be updated regularly throughout the course. Make sure to keep up to date by synchronizing your fork via GitHub. Should the virtual environment change as well (new dependencies to install), we will notify you - you can update the environment running the `uv sync` command again after starting the environment.

**Important: In order to avoid merge conflicts, always copy any files you work on (notebooks, scripts, data, etc.) to a user folder in each lecture or assignment folder, or create a new file under a different name.** This way you can always accept incoming changes, without altering your personal file versions. 

We do recommend to practice the git workflow throughout this course and to commit to your fork after significant changes. **If there are any problems with your IDE, uv, git or your repo, that prevent you from using the environment as intended, please notify us via mail immediately and don't wait until the next Q&A session.** 

## Course structure
Every week comprises two lecture slots on Wednesdays (odd numbers) and Fridays (even numbers).

**Homework assignments** will be introduced and reviewed on **Fridays (even slots)** and there will be the opportunity to discuss and get input on homework assignments on Wednesdays (odd slots). Homework assigned each Friday is due by 7:59 am on the following Friday to Dimitrios by email, with the subject "DSA103_26_Ex1_LastName_FirstName". Your homework will be checked and you will receive feedback; it will not be graded, but you must submit the homework assignments to be admitted to the exam. Please note that one of these homework assignments will be replaced by a small project introduced in session 17 that you have three weeks instead of one week to work on.
